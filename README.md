# Classifying Tweets Based on Sentiment Using Naive Bayes 
## Introduction
This project used a RapidMiner function to collect tweets containing the #BrettKavanuagh. These collected tweets were then used as data to use naive bayes to conduct a sentiment analysis. #BrettKavanaugh was chosen because of the amount of discussion over Twitter on his supreme court nomination and the allegations of his sexual assault. Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court on July 9, 2018. On September 14, 2018,the allegations of sexual assault towards Brett Kavanaugh by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford are made public. Discussion began to circulate about these allegations. On September 27, 2018 a hearing was held by the Senate Judiciary Committee. This hearing included the testimonies of both Kavanaugh and Ford. Discussion on Kavanaugh exploded at this time.

## Conclusion: 
### Insight From Data and Models



### Limitations of Research
***Sentiment Analysis***
One limitation of this research comes from in the biases when conducting the senitment analysis for the training data. First, we classified the Tweets based on the sentiments we believed they portrayed. However, considering Twitter is an online platform that contains various kinds of opinions, including satirical ones that would not easily be understood without understanding the goals of the author of the Tweet, there is plenty of room for human error. While we attempted to conduct as much research on the Twitter authors as possible, there were still some difficulties in how to best classify certain tweets. Second, words that do not necessarily carry a positive or negative sentiment in them are present in many of the tweets. Instead, the sentiment comes from the overall statement. Thus, some words are going to be present in the positive, negative, and overall statements. This may skew the results as the machine attempts to learn. 
***Images and Links***
Many of the tweets collected contained images and links that portrated Kavanaugh in certain ways. However, RapidMiner does not look at the content of these images and links, it only takes the content from the tweet itself. Thus it does not understand the sentiment of these tweets. We chose to classify these tweets as neutral, however the actual content of the tweet (the image or link) may not have been neutral. 
***Filtering out RTs and Links***
