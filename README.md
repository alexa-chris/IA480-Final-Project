***Sentiment Analysis***
One limitation of this research comes from in the biases when conducting the senitment analysis for the training data. First, we classified the Tweets based on the sentiments we believed they portrayed. However, considering Twitter is an online platform that contains various kinds of opinions, including satirical ones that would not easily be understood without understanding the goals of the author of the Tweet, there is plenty of room for human error. While we attempted to conduct as much research on the Twitter authors as possible, there were still some difficulties in how to best classify certain tweets. Second, words that do not necessarily carry a positive or negative sentiment in them are present in many of the tweets. Instead, the sentiment comes from the overall statement. Thus, some words are going to be present in the positive, negative, and overall statements. This may skew the results as the machine attempts to learn. 
Notes: images and links are impossible to classify. It will not classify the content of the link, thus stripping the status of the sentiment.
